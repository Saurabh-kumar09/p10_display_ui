# p10_display_application_controller

An IoT application built using Flutter & HTTP protocol.

## How the System Works:
1. The Flutter app takes an ESP8266 IP address and a message as input.
2. It sends an HTTP GET request to the ESP8266 server with the message appended as a query parameter.
3. The ESP8266 server receives the request, retrieves the message, and initiates scrolling the message on the LED matrix display.
